</pre>
<a name="NAME" href="#NAME"></a><h2>NAME  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#section_dir"><font size="-2">top</font></a></h2><pre>       console_codes - Linux console escape and control sequences
</pre>
<a name="DESCRIPTION" href="#DESCRIPTION"></a><h2>DESCRIPTION  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#section_dir"><font size="-2">top</font></a></h2><pre>       The Linux console implements a large subset of the VT102 and ECMA-48/ISO
       6429/ANSI X3.64 terminal controls, plus certain private-mode sequences for
       changing the color palette, character-set mapping, etc.  In the tabular
       descriptions below, the second column gives ECMA-48 or DEC mnemonics (the
       latter if prefixed with DEC) for the given function.  Sequences without a
       mnemonic are neither ECMA-48 nor VT102.

       After all the normal output processing has been done, and a stream of
       characters arrives at the console driver for actual printing, the first thing
       that happens is a translation from the code used for processing to the code
       used for printing.

       If the console is in UTF-8 mode, then the incoming bytes are first assembled
       into 16-bit Unicode codes.  Otherwise each byte is transformed according to
       the current mapping table (which translates it to a Unicode value).  See the
       <b>Character</b> <b>Sets</b> section below for discussion.

       In the normal case, the Unicode value is converted to a font index, and this
       is stored in video memory, so that the corresponding glyph (as found in video
       ROM) appears on the screen.  Note that the use of Unicode (and the design of
       the PC hardware) allows us to use 512 different glyphs simultaneously.

       If the current Unicode value is a control character, or we are currently
       processing an escape sequence, the value will treated specially.  Instead of
       being turned into a font index and rendered as a glyph, it may trigger cursor
       movement or other control functions.  See the <b>Linux</b> <b>Console</b> <b>Controls</b> section
       below for discussion.

       It is generally not good practice to hard-wire terminal controls into
       programs.  Linux supports a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> database of terminal capabilities.
       Rather than emitting console escape sequences by hand, you will almost always
       want to use a terminfo-aware screen library or utility such as <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/ncurses.3.html">ncurses(3)</a>,
       <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/tput.1.html">tput(1)</a>, or <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/reset.1.html">reset(1)</a>.
</pre><h3>Linux Console Controls</h3>
<pre>       This section describes all the control characters and escape sequences that
       invoke special functions (i.e., anything other than writing a glyph at the
       current cursor location) on the Linux console.

       <b>Control</b> <b>characters</b>

       A character is a control character if (before transformation according to the
       mapping table) it has one of the 14 codes 00 (NUL), 07 (BEL), 08 (BS), 09
       (HT), 0a (LF), 0b (VT), 0c (FF), 0d (CR), 0e (SO), 0f (SI), 18 (CAN), 1a
       (SUB), 1b (ESC), 7f (DEL).  One can set a "display control characters" mode
       (see below), and allow 07, 09, 0b, 18, 1a, 7f to be displayed as glyphs.  On
       the other hand, in UTF-8 mode all codes 00-1f are regarded as control
       characters, regardless of any "display control characters" mode.

       If we have a control character, it is acted upon immediately and then
       discarded (even in the middle of an escape sequence) and the escape sequence
       continues with the next character.  (However, ESC starts a new escape
       sequence, possibly aborting a previous unfinished one, and CAN and SUB abort
       any escape sequence.)  The recognized control characters are BEL, BS, HT, LF,
       VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, CAN, SUB, ESC, DEL, CSI.  They do what one would expect:

       BEL (0x07, <b>^G</b>) beeps;

       BS (0x08, <b>^H</b>) backspaces one column (but not past the beginning of the line);

       HT (0x09, <b>^I</b>) goes to the next tab stop or to the end of the line if there is
              no earlier tab stop;

       LF (0x0A, <b>^J</b>), VT (0x0B, <b>^K</b>) and FF (0x0C, <b>^L</b>) all give a linefeed, and if
              LF/NL (new-line mode) is set also a carriage return;

       CR (0x0D, <b>^M</b>) gives a carriage return;

       SO (0x0E, <b>^N</b>) activates the G1 character set;

       SI (0x0F, <b>^O</b>) activates the G0 character set;

       CAN (0x18, <b>^X</b>) and SUB (0x1A, <b>^Z</b>) interrupt escape sequences;

       ESC (0x1B, <b>^[</b>) starts an escape sequence;

       DEL (0x7F) is ignored;

       CSI (0x9B) is equivalent to ESC [.

       <b>ECMA-48</b> <b>CSI</b> <b>sequences</b>

       CSI (or ESC [) is followed by a sequence of parameters, at most NPAR (16),
       that are decimal numbers separated by semicolons.  An empty or absent
       parameter is taken to be 0.  The sequence of parameters may be preceded by a
       single question mark.

       However, after CSI [ (or ESC [ [) a single character is read and this entire
       sequence is ignored.  (The idea is to ignore an echoed function key.)

       The action of a CSI sequence is determined by its final character.

       The ECMA-48 SGR sequence ESC [ <i>parameters</i> m sets display attributes.  Several
       attributes can be set in the same sequence, separated by semicolons.  An empty
       parameter (between semicolons or string initiator or terminator) is
       interpreted as a zero.

               meta flag (ECMA-48 says "second alternate font").  The

</pre><h3>Character Sets</h3>
<pre>       The kernel knows about 4 translations of bytes into console-screen symbols.
       The four tables are: a) Latin1 -&gt; PC, b) VT100 graphics -&gt; PC, c) PC -&gt; PC, d)
       user-defined.

       There are two character sets, called G0 and G1, and one of them is the current
       character set.  (Initially G0.)  Typing <b>^N</b> causes G1 to become current, <b>^O</b>
       causes G0 to become current.

       These variables G0 and G1 point at a translation table, and can be changed by
       the user.  Initially they point at tables a) and b), respectively.  The
       sequences ESC ( B and ESC ( 0 and ESC ( U and ESC ( K cause G0 to point at
       translation table a), b), c) and d), respectively.  The sequences ESC ) B and
       ESC ) 0 and ESC ) U and ESC ) K cause G1 to point at translation table a), b),
       c) and d), respectively.

       The sequence ESC c causes a terminal reset, which is what you want if the
       screen is all garbled.  The oft-advised "echo ^V^O" will only make G0 current,
       but there is no guarantee that G0 points at table a).  In some distributions
       there is a program <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/reset.1.html">reset(1)</a> that just does "echo ^[c".  If your terminfo entry
       for the console is correct (and has an entry rs1=\Ec), then "tput reset" will
       also work.

       The user-defined mapping table can be set using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man8/mapscrn.8.html">mapscrn(8)</a>.  The result of the
       mapping is that if a symbol c is printed, the symbol s = map[c] is sent to the
       video memory.  The bitmap that corresponds to s is found in the character ROM,
       and can be changed using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man8/setfont.8.html">setfont(8)</a>.
</pre><h3>Mouse Tracking</h3>
<pre>       The mouse tracking facility is intended to return <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>-compatible mouse
       status reports.  Because the console driver has no way to know the device or
       type of the mouse, these reports are returned in the console input stream only
       when the virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These ioctls
       must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application such as the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man8/gpm.8.html">gpm(8)</a>
       daemon.

       The mouse tracking escape sequences generated by <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> encode numeric
       parameters in a single character as <i>value</i>+040.  For example, '!' is 1.  The
       screen coordinate system is 1-based.

       The X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence on button press encoding
       the location and the mouse button pressed.  It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 9
       h and disabled with ESC [ ? 9 l.  On button press, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> sends ESC [ M <i>bxy</i>
       (6 characters).  Here <i>b</i> is button-1, and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the x and y coordinates
       of the mouse when the button was pressed.  This is the same code the kernel
       also produces.

       Normal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape
       sequence on both button press and release.  Modifier information is also sent.
       It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 1000 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 1000 l.  On
       button press or release, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> sends ESC [ M <i>bxy</i>.  The low two bits of <i>b</i>
       encode button information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed,
       3=release.  The upper bits encode what modifiers were down when the button was
       pressed and are added together: 4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.  Again <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
       are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.  The upper left corner is
       (1,1).
</pre><h3>Comparisons With Other Terminals</h3>
<pre>       Many different terminal types are described, like the Linux console, as being
       "VT100-compatible".  Here we discuss differences between the Linux console and
       the two most important others, the DEC VT102 and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>.

       <b>Control-character</b> <b>handling</b>

       The VT102 also recognized the following control characters:

       NUL (0x00) was ignored;

       ENQ (0x05) triggered an answerback message;

       DC1 (0x11, <b>^Q</b>, XON) resumed transmission;

       DC3 (0x13, <b>^S</b>, XOFF) caused VT100 to ignore (and stop transmitting) all codes
              except XOFF and XON.

       VT100-like DC1/DC3 processing may be enabled by the tty driver.

       The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> program (in VT100 mode) recognizes the control characters BEL,
       BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, ESC.

       <b>Escape</b> <b>sequences</b>

       VT100 console sequences not implemented on the Linux console:

       ESC N       SS2   Single shift 2. (Select G2 character set for the next
                         character only.)
       ESC O       SS3   Single shift 3. (Select G3 character set for the next
                         character only.)
       ESC P       DCS   Device control string (ended by ESC \)
       ESC X       SOS   Start of string.
       ESC ^       PM    Privacy message (ended by ESC \)
       ESC \       ST    String terminator
       ESC * ...         Designate G2 character set
       ESC + ...         Designate G3 character set

       The program <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> (in VT100 mode) recognizes ESC c, ESC # 8, ESC &gt;, ESC =,
       ESC D, ESC E, ESC H, ESC M, ESC N, ESC O, ESC P ... ESC \, ESC Z (it answers
       ESC [ ? 1 ; 2 c, "I am a VT100 with advanced video option") and ESC ^ ... ESC
       \ with the same meanings as indicated above.  It accepts ESC (, ESC ), ESC *,
       ESC + followed by 0, A, B for the DEC special character and line drawing set,
       UK, and US-ASCII, respectively.

       The user can configure <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> to respond to VT220-specific control
       sequences, and it will identify itself as a VT52, VT100, and up depending on
       the way it is configured and initialized.

       It accepts ESC ] (OSC) for the setting of certain resources.  In addition to
       the ECMA-48 string terminator (ST), <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> accepts a BEL to terminate an OSC
       string.  These are a few of the OSC control sequences recognized by <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>:

       ESC ] 0 ; <i>txt</i> ST        Set icon name and window title to <i>txt</i>.
       ESC ] 1 ; <i>txt</i> ST        Set icon name to <i>txt</i>.
       ESC ] 2 ; <i>txt</i> ST        Set window title to <i>txt</i>.
       ESC ] 4 ; <i>num</i>; <i>txt</i> ST   Set ANSI color <i>num</i> to <i>txt</i>.
       ESC ] 10 ; <i>txt</i> ST       Set dynamic text color to <i>txt</i>.
       ESC ] 4 6 ; <i>name</i> ST     Change log file to <i>name</i> (normally disabled
                               by a compile-time option)
       ESC ] 5 0 ; <i>fn</i> ST       Set font to <i>fn</i>.

       It recognizes the following with slightly modified meaning (saving more state,
       behaving closer to VT100/VT220):

       ESC 7  DECSC   Save cursor
       ESC 8  DECRC   Restore cursor

       It also recognizes

       ESC F          Cursor to lower left corner of screen (if enabled by
                      <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>'s <b>hpLowerleftBugCompat</b> resource)
       ESC l          Memory lock (per HP terminals).
                      Locks memory above the cursor.
       ESC m          Memory unlock (per HP terminals).
       ESC n   LS2    Invoke the G2 character set.
       ESC o   LS3    Invoke the G3 character set.
       ESC |   LS3R   Invoke the G3 character set as GR.
       ESC }   LS2R   Invoke the G2 character set as GR.
       ESC ~   LS1R   Invoke the G1 character set as GR.

       It also recognizes ESC % and provides a more complete UTF-8 implementation
       than Linux console.

       <b>CSI</b> <b>Sequences</b>

       Old versions of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>, for example, from X11R5, interpret the blink SGR as
       a bold SGR.  Later versions which implemented ANSI colors, for example,
       XFree86 3.1.2A in 1995, improved this by allowing the blink attribute to be
       displayed as a color.  Modern versions of xterm implement blink SGR as
       blinking text and still allow colored text as an alternate rendering of SGRs.
       Stock X11R6 versions did not recognize the color-setting SGRs until the
       X11R6.8 release, which incorporated XFree86 xterm.  All ECMA-48 CSI sequences
       recognized by Linux are also recognized by <i>xterm</i>, however <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> implements
       several ECMA-48 and DEC control sequences not recognized by Linux.

       The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> program recognizes all of the DEC Private Mode sequences listed
       above, but none of the Linux private-mode sequences.  For discussion of
       <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a>'s own private-mode sequences, refer to the <i>Xterm</i> <i>Control</i> <i>Sequences</i>
       document by Edward Moy, Stephen Gildea, and Thomas E. Dickey available with
       the X distribution.  That document, though terse, is much longer than this
       manual page.  For a chronological overview,

           http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html

       details changes to xterm.

       The <i>vttest</i> program

           http://invisible-island.net/vttest/

       demonstrates many of these control sequences.  The <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> source
       distribution also contains sample scripts which exercise other features.

<a name="NOTES" href="#NOTES"></a><h2>NOTES  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#section_dir"><font size="-2">top</font></a></h2><pre>       ESC 8 (DECRC) is not able to restore the character set changed with ESC %.
</pre>
<a name="BUGS" href="#BUGS"></a><h2>BUGS  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#section_dir"><font size="-2">top</font></a></h2><pre>       In 2.0.23, CSI is broken, and NUL is not ignored inside escape sequences.

       Some older kernel versions (after 2.0) interpret 8-bit control sequences.
       These "C1 controls" use codes between 128 and 159 to replace ESC [, ESC ] and
       similar two-byte control sequence initiators.  There are fragments of that in
       modern kernels (either overlooked or broken by changes to support UTF-8), but
       the implementation is incomplete and should be regarded as unreliable.

       Linux "private mode" sequences do not follow the rules in ECMA-48 for private
       mode control sequences.  In particular, those ending with ] do not use a
       standard terminating character.  The OSC (set palette) sequence is a greater
       problem, since <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> may interpret this as a control sequence which
       requires a string terminator (ST).  Unlike the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/setterm.1.html">setterm(1)</a> sequences which will
       be ignored (since they are invalid control sequences), the palette sequence
       will make <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> appear to hang (though pressing the return-key will fix
       that).  To accommodate applications which have been hardcoded to use Linux
       control sequences, set the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man1/xterm.1.html">xterm(1)</a> resource <b>brokenLinuxOSC</b> to true.

       An older version of this document implied that Linux recognizes the ECMA-48
       control sequence for invisible text.  It is ignored.
